# Dynamic Organization System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a dynamic organization management system throughout the project budget system, replacing the hardcoded ENUM approach with a flexible database-driven solution.

## Initial Entities

- **SSCT**: Sarvajana Sneha Charitable Trust
- **SAES**: St. Ann's Education Society
- **Future**: Any additional organizations can be added dynamically

## Database Changes

### 1. New Organizations Table

- Created `Organizations` table for dynamic organization management
- Fields: organization_id, organization_code, organization_name, full_name, description, is_active, color_theme
- Supports unlimited organizations with custom color themes

### 2. Projects Table Update

- Replaced `organization` ENUM field with `organization_id` foreign key
- References Organizations table for flexible organization management
- Added index for better performance on organization-based queries

### SQL Migration

```sql
-- File: create_organizations_system.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Organizations (
    organization_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    organization_code VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    organization_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    color_theme VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'blue',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert initial organizations
INSERT INTO Organizations (organization_code, organization_name, full_name, description, color_theme) VALUES
('SSCT', 'SSCT', 'Sarvajana Sneha Charitable Trust', 'Primary charitable trust organization', 'blue'),
('SAES', 'SAES', 'St. Ann\'s Education Society', 'Educational society organization', 'pink');

-- Update Projects table
ALTER TABLE Projects ADD COLUMN organization_id INT AFTER project_center;
ALTER TABLE Projects ADD CONSTRAINT fk_projects_organization FOREIGN KEY (organization_id) REFERENCES Organizations(organization_id);
ALTER TABLE Projects DROP COLUMN organization;
```
