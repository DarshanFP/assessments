## Database Changes

### 1. Projects Table Update

- Added `organization` field as ENUM('SSCT', 'SAES') with default 'SSCT'

### SQL Migration

```sql
-- File: add_organization_field.sql
ALTER TABLE Projects
ADD COLUMN organization ENUM('SSCT', 'SAES') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'SSCT'
AFTER project_center;

CREATE INDEX idx_projects_organization ON Projects(organization);

ALTER TABLE Projects
MODIFY COLUMN organization ENUM('SSCT', 'SAES') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'SSCT'
COMMENT 'Organization operating the project: SSCT (Sarvajana Sneha Charitable Trust) or SAES (St. Ann''s Education Society)';
```

- **Overall**: Green theme (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`)

## Access Control

- Project creation: All authenticated users
- Project viewing: Based on existing role permissions

## Database Performance

- Optimized queries to include organization in GROUP BY clauses
- Maintained existing foreign key relationships

## Files Modified

1. `add_organization_field.sql` - Database migration
2. `ProjectBudgets/Blade/project_entry_form.php` - Form with organization selection
3. `ProjectBudgets/Controller/project_entry_process.php` - Controller logic
4. `ProjectBudgets/Blade/my_projects.php` - My projects view
5. `ProjectBudgets/Blade/all_projects.php` - All projects view
6. `ProjectBudgets/Blade/organization_reports.php` - New reports page
7. `sidebar_councillor.php` - Navigation updates
8. `includes/path_resolver.php` - Path resolution

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the database migration
2. Test project creation with both organizations
3. Verify organization display in project listings
4. Test organization reports functionality
5. Verify navigation and active states
6. Test with different user roles

## Future Enhancements

- Organization-based filtering in project listings
- Export functionality for organization reports
